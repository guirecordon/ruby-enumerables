# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

Microverse/Odin Project - Solo Project

>In this project, I implemented my own version of Ruby's enumerable methods. 
>I created them in a way that they should return the same results as the original when they are called. 
- each
- each_with_index
- select
- all
- any
- none
- count
- map
- inject

I test the methods all in the end of the document with the example tests provided in the Ruby documentation.
