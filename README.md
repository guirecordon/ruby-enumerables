# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

Microverse/Odin Project - Solo Project

>In this project, I implemented my own version of Ruby's enumerable methods. 
>I created them in a way that they should return the same results as the original when they are called. 
- each
- each_with_index
- select
- all
- any
- none
- count
- map
- inject

I kept a file called tests.rb in the root directory. It prints out the tests made for each method. You run it by typing `ruby tests.rb` inside of the root directory in the terminal.

The real Rspec tests, however, are run simply by running `rspec` or `rspec --format documentation` also inside of the root directory in the terminal.

Please reach out if there are any questions.
